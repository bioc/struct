#' struct: Statistics in R Using Class Templates
#'
#' This package defines classes for developing statistical workflows.
#' The idea is that these classes can be extended using other packages, making
#' it easier to combine methods from different packages into a robust workflow.
#'
#' @section Classes:
#' The classes include a \strong{dataset} object to standardise input of data
#' into methods, as well as a \strong{model} class for methods such as PLS, and
#' an \strong{iterator} class for methods #' such as permutation testing and
#' cross validation.
